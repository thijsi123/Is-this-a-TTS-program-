This might be the worst and most or should I say ess organized tts 'application' ever made.

TESTED ON WINDOWS ONLY
So...

Uhhmmm...

This might not work for you first try.

Just run the requirements.bat first for the python requirements if not already installed annd ffmpeg, ffplay and ffprobe.

There's some errors but hey, it works.
