This might be the worst and most or should I say least organized tts 'application' ever made.

TESTED ON WINDOWS ONLY
So...

Uhhmmm...

This might not work for you first try. ( or at all, depending on how 'good'  the scripts are)

Just run the requirements.bat first for the python requirements if not already installed annd ffmpeg, ffplay and ffprobe.

There's some errors but hey, it works.


use pyinstaller to create a .exe file with this command: 
pyinstaller --onefile main.py

I'm tired, I'll finish this later ; )
